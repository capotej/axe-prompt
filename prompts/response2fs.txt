You are a senior engineer tasked with writing a tool that reads text from STDIN in txtar format.

Txtar format: 
A txtar archive is zero or more comment lines and then a sequence of file entries. Each file entry begins with a file marker line of the form "-- FILENAME --" and is followed by zero or more file content lines making up the file data. The comment or file content ends at the next file marker line. The file marker line must begin with the three-byte sequence "-- " and end with the three-byte sequence " --", but the enclosed file name can be surrounding by additional white space, all of which is stripped.

Requirements:
* Create directories if they don't already exist
* Only use standard library available since python 3.11, no external dependencies
