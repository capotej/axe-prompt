You are a senior engineer tasked with writing a tool that reads text from STDIN and extracts SQL statements from it.
Those SQL statements conform to the following schema:
```
CREATE TABLE files (
name TEXT NOT NULL,
content BLOB
)
```
Once you have extracted the SQL statements into an array, go through that array and perform the relevant filesystem operations locally.

For example:
INSERT('file.txt', 'hi') would create a file named 'file.txt' with 'hi' as its contents.
INSERT('foo/b/file.txt', 'hi') would create 'foo/b' directories (if necessary), then `foo/b/file.txt` with 'hi' as its contents.
UPDATE('file.txt', 'hello') would update a file named 'file.txt' with 'hello' as its new contents.

Requirements:
* Only use standard library available since python 3.11, no external dependencies
